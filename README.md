# mini-cv

If you have ever felt the frustration of customizing your resume for every single job description, then mini-cv is for you. It allows you to customize your resume based on the skills you select.

With mini-cv, you write your resume once, and whenever you need to apply for a new job, you just filter out all the skills that are not related to that job description. This will give you a clean resume with items handpicked for a job description.
